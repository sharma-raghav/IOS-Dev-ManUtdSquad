# IOS-Dev-ManUtdSquad

It is a basic application of Table View Controller in IOS Development which I used to build/show a squad of Manchester United Players.

Home Screen
<img src = "App%20Screenshots/initial.png" height = "900" width = "400"/>

Adding a new Player Screen
<img src = "App%20Screenshots/selecting_player.png" height = "900" width = "400"/>

Home Screen after adding player
<img src = "App%20Screenshots/after_selecting_player.png" height = "900" width = "400"/>
